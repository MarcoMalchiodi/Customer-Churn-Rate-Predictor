# Customer-Churn-Rate-Predictor
My entry for a ML Kaggle competition

Customer Churn Rate Predictor leverages the power of three distinct machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost (XGB). 
To further enhance the predictive power of the XGBoost model, I employed a Randomized Search approach to fine-tune its hyperparameters.
